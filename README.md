# Bet Afalagi

Bet Afalagi is a Telegram Bot that enables people to create house listings for rent/sale. Listings created via the bot are shared to a telegram channel where prospective buyers/lesses look through available houses. The bot also enables house owners to close their listings and take them off the market. When a listing is closed, the listing is marked as such and the contact details of the listing owner are removed from the post.

Bet Afalagi also comes with an admin frontend where an admin can approve or decline pending listings. A listing is shared to the telegram channel when it received admin approval.
